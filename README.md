# AFED
Analysis of financial and economical data for forecasting.

# Research objectives
The main goal of this work is to learn how to apply data mining techniques to
solving problems of financial and economic data analysis.
Use the Bayesian network apparatus to model probabilistic problems and
predicting probabilistic variables as well as decision trees, regression models for
predict the absolute values of financial characteristics and compare them for
the selected data set. 

# Data description
RowNumber - corresponds to the record number (line) and does not affect the result. <br />
CustomerId - contains random values and does not affect the result.<br />
Surname - the client's last name does not affect his decision to leave the bank.<br />
CreditScore - can affect the outflow of customers because the customer with a higher
credit score is less likely to leave the bank.<br />
Geography - the location of the client can influence his decision
leave the bank.<br />
Gender - it is interesting to investigate whether gender plays a role in the outflow from the bank.<br />
Age is definitely relevant, as older clients are less likely to leave
your bank than younger.<br />
Tenure - means the number of years during which the client was a client of the bank. How
as a rule, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave the bank.<br />
Balance is also a very good indicator of customer outflow as people from
higher balance on the accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those who
has a lower balance.<br />
NumOfProducts - refers to the number of products that the customer has purchased through
bank. <br />

relevant because people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.<br />

EstimatedSalary - as on the balance sheet, people with lower salaries are more likely
leave the bank compared to those who have a higher salary.<br />
