# AFED
Analysis of financial and economical data for forecasting.

# Research objectives
The main goal of this work is to learn how to apply data mining techniques to
solving problems of financial and economic data analysis.
Use the Bayesian network apparatus to model probabilistic problems and
predicting probabilistic variables as well as decision trees, regression models for
predict the absolute values of financial characteristics and compare them for
the selected data set.
